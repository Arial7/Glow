#Welcome to the Glow
##What is Glow?
Glow is game engine written in C++. It features 2D rendering for now and later will also be able to render 3D Objects. It will always remain open source and free to use, because I write it just for fun. I use OpenGL 3 to render and GLFW 3 for the Input handling, window creation, etc. which means, that it will once be easy to port it to a lot of platforms (including Android, iOS and even native webbrowser support via emScripten).

##Can I get it?
Of course you can! Glow is free software and you can use and modify it. But please mention me if you create something with it.
For now, whilst developing the core functionality, I will only support Linux (and even there, I will not show you how to compile or use, you have to learn that by yourself (but then, it is just the standard `make` and then you can run the engine)).

##Planned features
Some planned features that I will hopefully implement in the future are:
- Multiple rendering backends (OpenGL 2, OpenGL ES 3)
- Editor (for building your favourite games)
- 3D rendering
- Multiple platform support (Linux, Window, Android) (OSX and iOS maybe will come too, if I find someone to maintain and check the code on these platforms)
- Build tool for easily exporting your project to the wanted platform
