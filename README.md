#Glow
Glow is (or rather will be) a 3D game engine written in C++. It will always remain open source and free to use, because I write it just for fun.
Glow uses OpenGL 3 to render and SDL 2 for the Input handling, window creation etc. which means, that it will once be easy to port it to a lot of platforms (including Android, iOS and even native webbrowser
support via emScripten).
For now, whilst developing the core functionality, I will only support Linux (and even there, I will not show you how to compile or use, you have to learn that by yourself).

Eventually Glow will have multiple rendering backends, (OpenGL 3+, OpenGL ES 2/3, OpenGL 2) for maximum compatibility.
Glow features a component based entity system (under heavy development right now)
