Todo List

High Priority
-------------

- Revap the positioning of elements by tranlating them in the shader, not on VAO creation
- Add input system
    - Key, mouse and eventually joystick input
    - Will be handled by an "Input" class, working similar to Unity3D's

Medium Priority
---------------
- Implement GL debugging (with a GL call wrapper)
- Start work on texturing
- Add UI elements as special renderable2Ds
    - Buttons
    - Labels
    - Checkboxes
    - Radio Buttons
    - (UI shader)

Low Priority
